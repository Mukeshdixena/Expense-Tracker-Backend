* 📝 **Add/Edit/Delete Expenses** – Track expenses by category and description.
* 📊 **Total Expense Summary** – Real-time display of total spending.
* 💳 **Premium Membership** – Integrated with **Cashfree** for payments.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
* **Database**: MySQL with Sequelize ORM
* **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
* **Payment Gateway**: Cashfree Payments
* **Deployment**: (Add details here - e.g., Render, Railway, Vercel, etc.)

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/expense-tracker.git
cd expense-tracker
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:

```env
DB_NAME=your_database
DB_USER=your_mysql_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

Run the app:

```bash
npx sequelize db:create
npx sequelize db:migrate
npm start
```

## 🧪 Testing

You can test the app using Postman or browser-based UI:

* `POST /user/signup`
* `POST /user/login`
* `POST /expense/add`
* `GET /expense/get`
* `DELETE /expense/delete/:id`
* `GET /purchase/premiummembership`

## 🧠 Challenges Faced

* Payment integration with **Cashfree** SDK.
* Secure JWT token management and role-based access.
* Efficient state updates and frontend performance.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Dark mode UI support
* Advanced filtering (by date/category)
* Monthly reports with charts (e.g., Chart.js)
